# README Update Summary

## What Was Changed

The README.md has been completely rewritten to accurately reflect the **Living Literary Map** project as it actually works.

### Before

- Focused on migration narratives, Harlem Renaissance, and Civil Rights landmarks
- Listed specific pre-loaded landmarks
- Limited feature descriptions
- Basic setup instructions

### After

- **Comprehensive feature overview**: PDF upload, title search, intelligent ranking
- **Detailed MCP architecture diagrams**: Shows full workflow from user input to map display
- **Two workflow explanations**:
  1. Book Location Extraction (PDF/Title → AI → Ranking → Map)
  2. MCP Agent Orchestration (User action → Conductor → Parallel agents → Synthesis)
- **Complete setup guide**: Step-by-step with prerequisites and environment variables
- **Use cases and examples**: Real-world applications of the tool
- **Project structure**: Full directory tree
- **Tech stack table**: Complete list of technologies used
