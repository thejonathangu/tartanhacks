## 🎓 What You Can Tell Judges

> "Our Living Literary Map uses the Model Context Protocol to orchestrate multiple
> AI agents that extract geographic locations from books. We demonstrate true MCP
> architecture with a ConductorAgent coordinating specialist agents in parallel—
> not just prompt chaining. Users can upload PDFs or search by title, and our AI
> automatically ranks locations by narrative importance (1-N), displaying them as
> numbered markers on an interactive Mapbox map. Every location includes quotes,
> historical context, and metadata extracted through intelligent prompting."

**Technical Highlights:**

- ✅ Parallel agent execution (ThreadPoolExecutor)
- ✅ Observable orchestration timeline
- ✅ Intelligent relevance ranking (1-10 → sorted 1-N)
- ✅ Dual input methods (PDF + title search)
- ✅ Real-time location extraction
